How to add a new operator?
Ans: 1) Add an entry to enum TokenKind identifying your operator
     2) Add an entry to to_string() specifying how to stringise the operator
     3) Add an entry to precedence() specifying the precedence of your 
        operator with respect to others
     4) Add your operator's visual representation to tokenise() in order to
        allow the tokeniser to uniquely identify the operator
